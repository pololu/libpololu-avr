== Installation & Usage Instructions ==

If you currently have an older version of our QTR sensor library, your
first step should be to delete the PololuQTRSensors directory from
your arduino-0011/hardware/libraries directory. If you don't
perform this step, the newer version of the library might not get
compiled.

Extract this archive to your arduino-0011/hardware/libraries directory.

You should now be able to use these libraries in your sketches by
selecting Sketch > Import Library > PololuQTRSensors from your Arduino
0011 IDE (or simply type #include <PololuQTRSensors.h> at the top of
your sketch). Note that you might need to restart your Arduino 0011
IDE before it sees the new libraries.

Please see the Library documentation at

http://www.pololu.com/docs/0J19 for more detailed information and
usage notes, including code examples.
